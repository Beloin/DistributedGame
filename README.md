# Project

A distributed `Small Game` using OpenGL and Linux native Socket connections.

In this project was implemented software tests using CMake (CTest).

## The Game

A simple triangle controller game. Each player will be a triangle running in a 500x500 screen. The player can move up,
down to the left and right `(ü°ë ü°ì ü°ê ü°í)`. The important thing here is the distributed part, where there's not going to
have a main server, every user will connect to each other and talk his place to everyone.

To achieve this Goal the programmer has two ways to implement it:

1. Centralized Option:
    - One of the players will be a coordenator and each moviment will be sent to it. So the coordenator have to send
      every connect_to the changed position.
    - This opion includes having a voting algorithm (Bully or ring) in order to choose the next coordenator if one of
      them fails to respond.
    - This option will help when having a shared resource.
1. Full distribuited option:
    - Won't have any coordenator, each change in places should be spread across every connect_to (see distributed
      algorithms).
    - The places should be acted as a resource, so it can be the same across the clients.
    - Will be slower, but won't need the voting algorithm.

For both the implementations will be needed a "start" point. Which means a connecting point to enter to that
distribuited group.

## The implementation

Each `player` will have a server code and a connect_to code, so it can reach out to other players and communicate it's
position.

Will be needed a main server to act as a "DNS" server, so this brings a questions, since it's necessary a DNS server,
why don't use a centralized option?

- The method will be a Fully distributed game. Each service will know the port of the other services.
- Later on will be implemented a voting system and remove the necessity of the prev knowledge
of all the services.

Main Modules:

1. Player
    - The player itself
2. Game
    - The game implementation
3. Client:
    - Involving how the communication will work, centralized or not.
    - Clients will warn other services it's existence.
4. Server
    - Involving how the communication will work, centralized or not.
    - For now the services will use the server and receive the players update as
a protocol.
   

## TODO:

- What about create a docker with it?
